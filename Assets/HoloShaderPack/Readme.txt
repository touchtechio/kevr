Holo Shader Pack Pro
by Martin Reintges & Wolfgang Tröstler

This package is partly WORK IN PROGRESS! You will receive frequent and free updates!
The main goal of this package is to provide a simple and cheap package to create great holo and sci-fi effects. Just apply the holo shader and see the difference between the default look and the projected one.
